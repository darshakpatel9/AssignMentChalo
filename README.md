This Project was done part assignement while appying for CHALO App.

Assignemnt was to create a form and store two locations with lang and lat. and locations in beetween those two point. store that data. and onother funcationality was to map and create a line on the maps or show route on the google map.CHALO App Assignment: Location Form and Mapping

This project was developed as part of an assignment for the CHALO App. The objective was to design and implement a form capable of storing two locations along with their respective latitude and longitude coordinates. Additionally, the system needed to calculate and store the intermediary locations between these two points. The data captured from this form was then stored for future use.

Functionality:

Location Form: Users can input two locations along with their latitude and longitude coordinates. The form captures this data accurately, enabling seamless storage for further processing.

Mapping and Route Display: Upon submission of the form, the system generates a visual representation of the route between the two provided locations. This is achieved by utilizing Google Maps API, allowing users to view the calculated route and intermediary points on the map interface.

How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install any necessary dependencies.
Set up the required environment variables, such as Google Maps API key.
Launch the application and access the location form.
Input the desired locations and submit the form.
View the generated route on the map interface.
Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Mapping: Google Maps API
